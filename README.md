# video_editor

This repo contains an extremely simple video trimmer that I developed to quickly handle videos during my project at NTU. 
Since I had deal with tens of videos and cut them into smaller ones (that makes hundreds of them), I found every free video editor not really helpful when it came to user speed.

The tool is very simple, it's written in Python and uses Tkinter as the GUI library.  

I will thoroughly comment that and add a screeshot here to explain every piece of the GUI in the future.

If you have any doubt or tip, feel free to contact me.
Thanks and enjoy!
